I organized **OMS/Practice Curated: Contemporary Scheduling** session
at the conference. Session was about the Operations Research applications and attracted
about forty people.

I presented my work, **Network Design with Routing Consideration**, where we developed 
a network design algorithm to identify location of distribution facilities
by considering store deliveries.
