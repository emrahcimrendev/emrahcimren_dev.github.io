Vehicle routing problem (VRP) is identifying the optimal set of routes for a set of 
vehicles/fleet/transportation modes to travel in order to deliver to a given 
set of customers. When vehicles have limited carrying capacity and 
customers have time windows within which the deliveries must be made, problem becomes
capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows (CVRPTW). 
In this post, we will discuss how to tackle CVRPTW using Python and 
get a fast and robust solution.
