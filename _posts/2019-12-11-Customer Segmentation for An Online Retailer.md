In this post, we provide a customer segmentation application for an online apparel retailer. 
Our objective is to divide the customer groups into sub-groups
where each member in each group is very similar
by some measure to each other and very dissimilar to members
in all other groups.

Segmentation is the part of the assortment planning process where we decide right products 
at the right quantity at the right price in the right place at the right time. 
The following is the assortment planning framework typically followed by retailers.

### What is Segmentation?

Segmentation is the process of classifying customers into groups (segments) based on 
observed or inferred characteristics, behaviors, and preferences. 

The objective of segmentation is to understand 

- Who is buying the product, 
- How they buy,
- What attributes they value (and don’t value),
- What price they are willing to pay.

Then, they are classified into groups based on these characteristics.
