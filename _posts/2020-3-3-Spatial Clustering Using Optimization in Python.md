In this post,
we provide an optimization based spatial clustering algorithm. 
We use this algorithm to solve a facility location problem which
is identifying 
optimal distribution center locations for a given demand network
to minimize cost.

Spatial data represents the location, size, and shape of an object 
on planet Earth such as a building, lake, mountain or township. 
Spatial clustering aims to partition spatial data into a series of 
meaningful subclasses, called spatial clusters.
