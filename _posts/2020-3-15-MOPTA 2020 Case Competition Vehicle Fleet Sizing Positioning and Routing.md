The goal of the competition this year is to solve an
optimal vehicle routing problem where in addition, the
location of depots for the vehicles and the fleet size
should be optimized. In this post, we provide a solution
to this problem.

## Problem

Determine set of depots, the number of vehicles, and routing of each vehicle per depot 
to be able to serve the demand by minimizing the total cost. This problem is classified
as "location-routing problem" in the literature.

The detailed problem description is provided at the 
[competition web page](https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/~mopta/mopta2020/AIMMS_MOPTA_case_2020.pdf).

We now look at problem components.
