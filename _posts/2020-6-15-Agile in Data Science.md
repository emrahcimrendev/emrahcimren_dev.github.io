Agile in data science

Preparation
- Epics for major initiatives
- Create a high level plan stating user stories with end times make sure that
you capture everything. 
- Allocate each user story to a sprint.
- Create user stories in the Jira board.

Plan Sprints
- Look backlog and pull user stories to each sprint
- Point them based on fibonacci numbers
- Create tasks for each user stories

Ground Rules
- Not too big user stories
- Maker sure that each user story includes an objective and acceptance criteria
which is the definition of the user story completion
- Mark the ones required code development and connect them to GitHub
- Connect the stories if necessary
- Make sure that total points for each person is manageable
    - e.g min 15 points max 25 points
- No more two sprints to complete a user story
    
Monitoring the performance
- Monitor burndown chart to make sure that we are on track
- Schedule Retros after each sprint to cover what is being done or not
- Follow up for retros
    - What should we start doing?
    - What should we stop doing?
    - What should we keep doing?
   
Schedule a demo for each feature after a sprint
