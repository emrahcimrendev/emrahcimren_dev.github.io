In this post, I will share my data science management experience. 
I manage an analytics team which 
develops, implements, and executes 
analytical models to support operational and
strategic decisions.

I find the following priciples and guidelines very useful help my team's success. 
I will explain them as follows. 

## 1. Define Vision, Mission, and Values

Vision and mission serve as a guide for creating objectives and goals in the team, 
thus providing a road-map that is to be followed by everyone.

A vision statement is used to describe the future state of the team. 
It is a long-term goal provides direction for the team. 
It also communicates the purpose of the team to the individuals 
and broader organization and provides them with the inspiration to achieve that purpose.

A mission statement describes the current state of a team 
and its primary goals or objectives. 
It provides detailed information about what the team does, how it does it, and who it does it for. 
It is related to the vision statement in that it outlines the primary goals that will help to achieve the future the team desires.

The values statement defines what the team believes in and how people in the team are expected to behave.

### Vision

Empower business to make their own decisions by providing
comprehensive analytical what-if modeling products.

### Mission

Develop analytical products to drive the business to ideal state by reducing 
total landed cost to benefit enterprise margins/profits and satisfying customers.

### Values

We embrace the following values.

- **Continually satisfy your customer:** Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of analytical products.
- **Embrace change:** We welcome evolving customer needs and embrace them to generate competitive advantage.
- **It’s a team sport, reduce heroism:** Analytic teams should strive to reduce heroism and create sustainable and scalable data analytic teams and processes.
- **Close interactions:** Customers, analytic teams, and operations must work together very close throughout the project.
- **Self-organize:** The best analytic insight, algorithms, architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- **Reflect:** Analytic teams should fine-tune their operational performance by self-reflecting, at regular intervals, on feedback provided by their customers, themselves, and operational statistics.
- **Analytics is code:** Analytic teams use a variety of individual tools to access, integrate, model, and visualize data. Fundamentally, each of these tools generates code and configuration which describes the actions taken upon data to deliver insight.
- **Orchestrate;** The beginning-to-end orchestration of data, tools, code, environments, and the analytic teams work is a key driver of analytic success.

• Value working analytics. We believe the primary measure of data analytics performance is the degree to which insightful analytics are delivered, incorporating accurate data, atop robust frameworks and systems.

Make it reproducible. Reproducible results are required, and therefore, we version everything: data, low-level hardware and software configurations, and the code and configuration specific to each tool in the toolchain.
Disposable environments. We believe it is important to minimize the cost for analytic team members to experiment by giving them easy to create, isolated, safe, and disposable technical environments that reflect their production environment.
Simplicity. We believe that continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility; likewise simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential.
Analytics is manufacturing. Analytic pipelines are analogous to Lean manufacturing lines. We believe a fundamental concept of DataOps is a focus on process thinking aimed at achieving continuous efficiencies in the manufacture of analytic insight.
Quality is paramount. Analytic pipelines should be built with a foundation capable of automated detection of abnormalities (jidoka) and security issues in code, configuration, and data and should provide continuous feedback to operators for error avoidance (poka yoke).
Monitor quality and performance. Our goal is to have performance, security, and quality measures that are monitored continuously to detect unexpected variation and generate operational statistics.
Reuse. We believe a foundational aspect of analytic insight manufacturing efficiency is to avoid the repetition of previous work by the individual or team.
Improve cycle times. We should strive to minimize the time and effort to turn a customer need into an analytic idea, create it in development, release it as a repeatable production process, and finally refactor and reuse that product.
