I find the following priciples and guidelines very useful help my team's success. 
I will explain them as follows. 

## 1. Vision, Mission, and Values

Vision and mission serve as a guide for creating objectives and goals in the team, 
thus providing a road-map that is to be followed by everyone.

A vision statement is used to describe the future state of the team. 
It is a long-term goal provides direction for the team. 
It also communicates the purpose of the team to the individuals 
and broader organization and provides them with the inspiration to achieve that purpose.

A mission statement describes the current state of a team 
and its primary goals or objectives. 
It provides detailed information about what the team does, how it does it, and who it does it for. 
It is related to the vision statement in that it outlines the primary goals that will help to achieve the future the team desires.

**Vision:** Empower business to make their own decisions by providing
comprehensive analytical what-if modeling products.

**Mission:** Develop analytical products to drive the business to ideal state.

**Values:**
