In this post, I will share my data science management experience. 
I manage an analytics team which 
develops, implements, and executes 
analytical models to support operational and
strategic decisions. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images//Managing A Data Science Team/management.png)

I find the following principles and guidelines very useful for my team's success.  

## 1. Define Vision, Mission, and Values

Vision and mission serve as a guide for creating objectives and goals in the team, 
thus providing a road-map that is to be followed by everyone.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images//Managing A Data Science Team/9B51CF95-F079-405B-8819-DEDA37578B29.jpeg)

A vision statement is used to describe the future state of the team. 
It is a long-term goal provides direction for the team. 
It also communicates the purpose of the team to the individuals 
and broader organization and provides them with the inspiration to achieve that purpose.

A mission statement describes the current state of a team 
and its primary goals or objectives. 
It provides detailed information about what the team does, how it does it, and who it does it for. 
It is related to the vision statement in that it outlines the primary goals that will help to achieve the future the team desires.

The values statement defines what the team believes in and how people in the team are expected to behave.

### Vision

Empower business to make their own decisions by providing
comprehensive analytical what-if modeling products.

### Mission

Develop analytical products to drive the business to ideal state by reducing 
total landed cost to benefit enterprise margins/profits and satisfying customers.

### Values

We embrace the following values.

- **Continually satisfy your customer:** 
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through 
the early and continuous delivery of analytical products.

- **Embrace change:** 
We listen customer needs and 
embrace them to generate competitive advantage.

- **Value working analytics:** 
We believe the primary measure of data analytics performance 
is the degree to which insightful analytics are delivered, 
incorporating accurate data, atop robust frameworks and systems.

- **Team sport:** 
Analytic teams should strive to reduce heroism and create sustainable 
and scalable data analytic teams and processes.

- **Close interactions:** 
Customers, analytic teams, and operations 
must work together very close throughout the project.

- **Self-organize:** 
The best analytic insight, algorithms, 
architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

- **Reflect:** 
Analytic teams should fine-tune their operational performance by 
self-reflecting, at regular intervals, on feedback provided by 
their customers, themselves, and operational statistics.

- **Orchestrate:** 
The beginning-to-end orchestration of data, tools, code, 
environments, and the analytic teams work is a key driver of analytic success.

- **Make it reproducible:** 
Reproducible results are required, and therefore, we version everything: 
data, low-level hardware and software configurations, and the code and 
configuration specific to each tool in the toolchain.

- **Reuse:** 
We believe a foundational aspect of analytic insight manufacturing 
efficiency is to avoid the repetition of previous work by the individual or team.

- **Simplicity:** 
We believe that continuous attention to technical excellence and good design 
enhances agility; likewise simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of 
work not done – is essential.

- **Disposable environments:** 
We believe it is important to minimize the cost for analytic team members 
to experiment by giving them easy to create, isolated, safe, and disposable 
technical environments that reflect their production environment.

- **Analytics is manufacturing:** 
Analytic pipelines are analogous to Lean manufacturing lines. 
We believe a fundamental concept of DataOps is a focus on process thinking 
aimed at achieving continuous efficiencies in the manufacture of analytic insight.

- **Quality is paramount:** 
Analytic pipelines should be built with a foundation capable of automated 
detection of abnormalities (jidoka) and security issues in code, configuration, 
and data and should provide continuous feedback to operators for error avoidance.

- **Monitor quality and performance:** 
Our goal is to have performance, security, and quality measures that 
are monitored continuously to detect unexpected variation and generate 
operational statistics.

- **Improve cycle times:** 
We should strive to minimize the time and effort to turn a customer need 
into an analytic idea, create it in development, release it as a repeatable 
production process, and finally refactor and reuse that product.

### Description of Products and Services

Four types of products/services can be developed by a data science team. 

| **Product** | Type | **Description** | **Effort**|
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| White glove data | Product | Develop data products to understand data and gain insights  | Data engineering | 
| White glove model | Product | Develop models to make predictions | Data engineering and model development | 
| Analysis | Service |Utilize white data and model products to make recommendations | Analysis and recommendations | 
| Advisory | Service |Be a thought partner and give directions based on experience | Recommendation |

White glove can be data or model products. 
Figure 1 illustrates steps to build a white glove product.
Data products is used to understand data and gain insights. 
Model products are build on the top of the data products
and are used to make predictions. Products can be delievered
in the form of API's, code libraries, or web dashboards.

In the Analysis, white glove products are used to
answer business questions and make recommendations.

Team can also provide an Advisory service where
they become a thought partner and give directions
based on an experience. This service does not require
any new development or utilization
of a product.

## 2. Define Roles and Responsibilities

When you set clear roles and responsibilities, 
everyone knows what’s expected of them within the group. 
They know how to behave, what they need to accomplish, 
and how to reach the group’s goals.
People work together better when they understand their roles.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images//Managing A Data Science Team/team.jpg)

I use a matrix 
to define roles and responsibilities. 
Figure 2 illustrates an example. 
This matrix defines expectations 
for each job level in the team.

## 3. Plan and Execute Projects

Planning in management is about what steps you need to take to reach the goal, 
what changes and hurdles to anticipate, 
and how to utilize human resources and opportunities 
to reach the expected outcome. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images//Managing A Data Science Team/team.jpg)

A goal is where your team wants to be in a certain time. 
A plan is a description of how you are going to get there.  
We follow agile methodology to execute plans.

The following are steps of the planning process.

### 3.1. Set Annual Team Goals

### 3.2. Develop Quarterly Plan

### 3.3. Develop Project Plans for Each Project in the Quarterly Plan

### Typical Data Science Project Steps

### Business Intake Process

### 3.4. Execute Plans using Agile Methodology

### What is Agile Methodology?

### How to Execute Plans?

### 3.5. Perform After Action Review


- Annual team goals
- Quarterly plan
- Project plans
- Sprint plans
- User stories




Planning dictates how to effectively organise business, that is to determine the necessary activities, assign them to proper personnel, delegate authority, provide tools and raw material, etc.  
Having a plan facilitates directing as it makes instructions, guidance, and motivation grounded in a brand strategy
Planning informs staffing, as it shows what work-force a company will need 
Establishment of standards and measurement of actual performance – controlling – is done against the expectations that planning sets
